# This is a properties file with the default string messages. Other messages.properties files contain localizations.

index.welcome=Welcome!

# What if our message contains parameters? For example, if our profile page says "Welcome, ${name}!" then we need to
# include the name in the message somehow. This is done by using message arguments, like so:
profile.greeting=Hello, {0}!

register.title=Welcome
register.subtitle=Register your new user
registerForm.email=Email:
registerForm.email.hint=Email
registerForm.password=Password:
registerForm.password.hint=Password
registerForm.repeatPassword=Repeat password:
registerForm.repeatPassword.hint=Repeat password
registerForm.submit=Register

# To set error messages for form validation annotations (such as @Size, in UserForm.java), we can add messages here
# with the exact name as the annotation:
# Size=This value is either too long or too short, you dumbass!
# However, this is not very useful. What do we specify for the @Pattern annotation? We might have multiple validations
# with different regexes, so we'd want to have different messages for each usage of a @Pattern validation.
# The way we can do this is by instead of calling the property just "Pattern", we can call it
# Pattern.<jspParamName>.<formParamName>, and the message will be used for any @Pattern within a form named
# <jspParamName>, for the parameter named <formParmaName>. Example:
Email.registerForm.email=This must be a valid email address
Size.registerForm.email=Your email must be between {2} and {1} characters.
Size.registerForm.password=Your password must be at least {2} characters.
Size.registerForm.repeatPassword=Your password must be at least {2} characters.
